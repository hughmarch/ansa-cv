## Nucleation Site Analysis for HIV Viral Load Monitoring

*Viral Load - a measure of how much virus is in someone's body, usually an indicator for the severity and/or transmissibility of an infection.*

As of 2021, there were approximately 38.4 million people living with HIV. People living with HIV require routine viral load monitoring in order to measure treatment efficacy and adherence. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the gold standard for measuring viral load (think nasal swab COVID testing), but is not accessible to many clinics and patients around the world due to its high cost and long wait times. As a result, PCR is limited to centralized testing facilities far from the point-of-care (POC), leading to delayed results or loss of follow-up. The majority of people living with HIV live in low- and middle-income countries where PCR testing is largely inaccessible, so there is a need to develop a robust POC viral load test.
