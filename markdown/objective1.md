The objective of this project project is to address the limited dynamic range (the ratio of highest measurable viral load/lowest measurable viral load) of this test by investigating the effect viscosity has on nucleation site formation. In theory, increasing the viscosity of the RPA reaction will limit site diffusion and merging with neighboring sites and allow us to quantify at higher copy numbers/viral loads.
