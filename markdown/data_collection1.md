### Data collection

In previous work we perform RPA reactions on a fiber membrane, which works well enough, but to better measure the effects of viscosity and reduce background noise, we instead sandwich the RPA solution in between two glass slides.

To achieve higher viscosities, we increase the concentration of the crowding agent Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) in solution. At a high-level, since PEG is a really long molecule or polymer, it's going to make it harder for everything else in the solution to move around, making it harder for nucleation sites to spread.

We have run two RPA experiments on the glass slides at different PEG concentrations (both at 1000cps of HIV DNA):
<ul>
<li>1.5% PEG (standard amount of PEG in RPA reactions)</li>
<li>6.78% PEG (additional PEG added to RPA reaction)</li>
</ul>
