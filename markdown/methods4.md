Let's just look at one nucleation site. To the right, we crop out one nucleation site from our preprocessed (post blur step) image and make a surface plot of the pixel intensity. The x- and y-axes are the spatial dimensions of the image. One thing to notice is that this intensity plot is a smooth curve, so there isn't any distinct border defined for the site. We chould choose a threshold intensity value and define our border arbitrarily as being where the intensity of the site crosses the threshold, but then less bright spots will be measured to have a smaller radius as a side effect.
