Our research group has addressed this by developing an HIV viral load test using recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), which has a 20 minute sample-to-answer time and is more appropriate for POC settings. Our test involves the formation of discrete fluorescent nucleation sites (showing as bright spots on fluorescence images) which can be counted to estimate the viral load (more spots correlates to higher viral load). However, our test fails to accurately quantify higher HIV viral loads. At higher viral loads, sites begin to merge, and individual spots become hard to distinguish:
