What we're going to do instead is approximate our site with a 2D Gaussian curve fitted using scipy's optimization tools. Similar to our site intensity, the Gaussian distribution doesn't have any hard cutoffs, so we don't define any explicit boundary. Instead we get a standard deviation value (actually two, one for each of the x- and y-axes, but we just use the average of these two). We can define our radius now based on the standard deviation, and since amplitude (brightness) is independent of standard deviation, our radius won't be affected by site intensity. To measure site intensity, we use the maximum of our fitted Gaussian curve.
